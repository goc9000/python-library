"""
A collection of utilities potentially useful for any Python program, irrespective of function.

The defining feature of these utilities is that they refer to and extend the Python language itself. They do not use
any specific operating system features or connect to any specific real-world application. They are just highly abstract
idioms for iteration and data structure processing that may come in handy anywhere.
